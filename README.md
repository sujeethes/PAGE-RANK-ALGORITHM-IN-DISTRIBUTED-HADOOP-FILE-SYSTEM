# PAGE-RANK-ALGORITHM-IN-DISTRIBUTED-HADOOP-FILE-SYSTEM
In this project we will implement a python program to analyze the number of users based on
the page rank algorithm.
The page rank algorithm can be executed on the local operating system when the number of page
rank algorithms is small.
• To calculate it at a faster rate and increase the efficiency of the algorithm, we need to run this
algorithm on parallel systems and distributed systems
• There are five large-scale performance engines that support page rank algorithms that contain
large amounts of data: - Hadoop, MPI, Dryad, Pregel, Twister.
• We have used python for parallel page rank algorithm which is executed on HADOOP.
